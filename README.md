# Lynk Backend

lynk should be a student marketplace for student bubbles of different universities.

only actual students should be allowed to register and use the platform

the platform should help students to:

- sell / buy stuff from other students
- connect to other students and make friends
- help each other
- inform each other


this will be a way for me to learn spring boot api development, taking high prio in clean architecture and test driven development
